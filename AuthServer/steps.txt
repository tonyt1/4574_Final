docker-compose build
docker-compose up

docker ps (To get id's of the 2 images)

For web:
docker exec [web id] service mongodb start
*Success*

For db:
docker exec [db id] service mongod start
*Failed*
docker exec [db id] service mongod restart
*Failed*

Overall:
Can connect to my server via web interface. 
It fails because mongod isn't running and crashes when trying to make a mongodb command
